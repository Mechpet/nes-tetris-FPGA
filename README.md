# nes-tetris-FPGA
Implementation of NES Tetris on FPGA (final project for ECE 385 - Digital Systems Laboratory).

The game is similar to NES Tetris except for the drop speeds and spin speeds. The spin speed (rotation) is lower and the drop speeds are also lower.

There are more levels in this version as well (that are plausible to reach for normal players). The game supports keyboard input only.
